# Software Workshops
These are the workshops that are used to teach our new programmers java and ftc programming. It goes from the very basics of data up to more complex concepts such as Polymorphism and Functional Interfaces. These workshops are majority PowerPoints with the occasional PDF. The workshops are read only. You are encouraged to use these workshops in any way you feel best.
